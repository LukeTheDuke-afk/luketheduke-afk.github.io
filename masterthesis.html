    <h3>Evaluating Methods for Procedural Vegetation Generation Distribution: Balancing Computational Efficiency and Visual Fidelity</h3>
    <p>My master theis was about evaluating diffferent methods for Procedural Vegetation Generation.
        After some reserach and consideration I settled on three different methods to compare: Perlin Noise Distribution, Poisson Disk Sampling Distribution and Field-Of-Neighborhood Distribution.
        The methods were evaluated and compared against one another using the metrics of computational efficiency and visual fidelity.
        Computational efficiency was measured using processing time, i.e the time it took for each method to populate the terrain.
        For visual fidelity, a user study was conducted using 25 participants from around Europe, who got to experience each method in a first person-perspective and make a determination on which method was the most realistic.
        The goal of the thesis was to identifiy which method, if any, best balanced the computational cost of placing vegetation with the percieved realism of the outcome.
        While each method had its own strengths and weaknesses, the results suggest that when aiming for a good balance between the two fields, Poisson Disk Sampling Distribution is the best method to use.

    <h3>Perlin Noise Distribution</h3>
    <p>In this method, the vegetation was procedurally distributed based on the values generated from a 2D Perlin noise map.
    The map was created corresponding to the size of the terrain, where each pixel on the map represented the density value for a specific position on the terrain.
    Each point on the terrain was then compared to a pre-defined target density, and if the noise map value exceeded that density threshold, a potential placement location was generated.</p>

    <h3>Poisson Disk Sampling Distribution</h3>
    <p>In this method, vegetation was distributed in accordance with Poisson Disk Sampling. The terrain was divided into cells, and within each cell, a probable number of plants were distributed.
    Each plant type had a defined outer radius that dictated the minimum distance between it and other plants.
    The largest vegetation, the spruce tree, had the largest outer radius, and the smallest vegetation, the grass,
    had the smallest. The plant with the largest radius was placed first</p>

    <section id="fon">
    <h3>Field-Of-Neighborhood Distribution</h3>
    <p> In this method, the distribution was made using the Field-Of-Neighborhood model. Each plant type was assigned two key attributes: an influence radius and a placement threshold. The
    influence radius refers to the radius around each plant within which it can influence the placement of other
    plants. The influence within this radius follows a Gaussian decay function, meaning that the influence
    diminishes exponentially as the distance from the plant increases. The placement threshold refers to
    the maximum amount of influence that a neighboring plant can exert on a new plant in order for it to
    be considered for placement. If a plant’s influence on a neighboring plant exceeds this threshold, the
    neighboring plant will not be placed in that area. </p>
