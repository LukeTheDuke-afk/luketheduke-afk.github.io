        <h1>TwinBound (2025)</h1>
        <h3>A local co-op 2.5D platformer game.</h3>
        <p>
          TwinBound is a game about a set of twins. They are held against their will in a mysterious underground laboratory, 
          where they are subject to a multitude of experiments to test the mythological connections between twins. 
          Both of them yearn to escape, and when an opporunity appears they must work together to reach the surface and return 
          to the real world. But not all is as it seems, and it would appear that the mysterious connection between twins is actually real...

    <h1>My work on TwinBound</h1>
    <h3>Static Game Art</h3>
    <p>My main responsibility for TwinBound related to the static art of the game. The 2D Art was created in Photoshop, and includes the background, platform textures, and the dirt tiles.
      The 3D art was created with Blender and includes the potion, buttons and lamps.

  <h3>Sound Design and Code</h3>
  <p>As a secondary responsibility I worked on the sound design for TwinBound. This included enhancing the user experience by adding sound queues to action such as pressing buttons or collecting potions.
    I also created the sound track for the game, which includes the intro screen song as well as the song that plays during the gameplay. Most sounds were sourced from royalty free website, but the music was crafted by me using FL Studios.
