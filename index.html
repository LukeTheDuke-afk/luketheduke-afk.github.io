    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Lucas Åkesson (he/him). Currently 26 years of age, and a recent graduate with both a BSC and a MSc (SE: Civilingenjör) in Interactive Mediatechnology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
      I am an avid gamer, and have been since I recieved my very first game console (a Gameboy Advance SP I still own and cherish to this day) at the age of around 8 or 9.
      I thoroughly enjoy every aspect of video games, from playing them to creating them, and have been a part of a few very interesting game projects during my time at KTH.
      All of these projects, as well as some personal work, can be found within this portfolio. They range from 3D artistry and character design, to environment art, level design and sound design.
      If you have any questions or want to learn more about me and my work, don't hesitate to reach out via email or on LinkedIn!
